<h2>COMPARISON OF TWO ALGORITHMS -DECISION TREE AND ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK </h2>
The accuracy and other performance metrics of two classification algorithms were compared in this </h2>
study. Decision Tree Classification Algorithm and Artificial Neural Network were the two MLAs whose
performance were compared. The two MLAs were implemented on the PIMA India Diabetes dataset.
The result of the comparison depicted that ANN performed better than decision tree classifier as it has
better classification accuracy. Azure machine learning was also used to implement the classification
algorithms on the dataset and the comparison of the result shows it is in tandem with the analysis
carried out in Jupyter notebook..

* datasets used for CLASSIFICATION was downloaded from https://data.world/data-society/pima-indians-diabetes-databas

    <h2>Association rule mining was implemented an online retail dataset.</h2> 
    Apriori ARM method was used to
establish the relationships for the items/products that were bought together based on different the
transactions done in some countries in the dataset. The result of the ARM was obtained for at least 8
countries in the dataset to show the items/products that were frequently bought together. The lift,
support and the confidence are the three metrics that were used to determine how often customers lift
these products together from the shelf. The result of the mining technique was used to inform retailers
the products that were actually bought together in each of the transactional countries.

*Sentiment Analysis Jupyter notebook code
  - Codes are saved as ADEBANJO_YEMISI.IPYNB
*Sentiment analysis was carried out on tourist dataset using VADER module of nltk python library. The
dataset contains the customers‚Äô review of the hotels/Restaurant. 30 distinct hotels were selected and
the VADER implemented to calculate the polarity scores of the customers‚Äô review for each of the hotel,
this was in turn used to categorize the review s into positive, neutral and negative sentiments. The
result of the study shows that 28 of the 30 randomly selected hotels/Restaurant have positive
reviews/sentiments from their customers while the remaining 2 have a negative review/sentiment.

(data1 = df.drop_duplicates(subset=["Hotel"], keep="last").sample(n=30,random_state=1)

*Association Rule in Jupyter notebook code
  - Codes are saved as Clustering(Task 3).IPYNB

*In this study, two Clustering Algorithms namely K means Clustering and BIRCH Clustering Algorithms
were implemented on a dataset. To implement the Clustering Algorithms, the dataset was pre-
processed to identify the invariate and the most suitable variables for the analyses. After pre-processing,
the elbow method was used to identify the number of clusters appropriate for the Clustering
techniques. Then two Clustering Algorithms were then implemented based on the number of clusters.
After implementation of the Algorithms, the result gotten showed the same cluster pattern for the two
Algorithms used.
